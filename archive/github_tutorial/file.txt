Files

This, this right here, is a file
A file is this, there's no denial

We'll teach you stuff in RoboJackets
Learn to send, radio packets

Learning source control, you'll have fun
We ditched svn, cause git has won

See all about, compiling files
Just leave out, infinite whiles

Our senior members, know Unix
Have helped write code, near Munich
[Watch us lose, against ZJUNlict]

We'll fly you, across the Atlantic
When you know, our coding semantics

We always code, in proper style
The extra work, it's worthwile

Code systems with interruptions
But assemble, with the right instructions

We have circuits, in a pile
They had bugs, we exhiled

Our HDL, it's synthesized
The binary, too oversized

It all starts with, a low pass filter
Before you know it, you're a robot builder!
