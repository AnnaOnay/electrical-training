* Basics
** How Solder Works
   #+ATTR_HTML: :height 80%, :width 80%
   [[./5_resources/Through hold ex.jpg]]
   - Wetting
     - When hot enough solder forms alloy with pin & pad
   - Attracts to hottest part
** Good Solder Joints
   #+ATTR_HTML: :height 80%, :width 80%
   [[./5_resources/Through hold ex.jpg]]
   - Use correct amount of solder
   - Cold joint: solder did not melt completely
   - Ensure solder completely bonds with pin and pad (wetting)
** Tools
   | Soldering Iron                   | Hot Air Gun                   | Reflow Oven                   |
   | [[./5_resources/Soldering Iron.jpg]] | [[./5_resources/Hot Air Gun.jpg]] | [[./5_resources/Reflow Oven.jpg]] |
   - Flux
     - Remove oxides to allow better solder connections
   - Tweezers
     - Hold small components when soldering
* Soldering With Iron
[[./5_resources/Soldering Iron.jpg]]
** Safety
   - Hold the iron like a pencil
   - Entire metal end gets hot (don't touch)
   - Always assume iron is hot
   - When not in use put back in holder

** Main Tools 
   | Solder                   | Sponge & Brass Sponge          | Flux                   |   
   | [[./5_resources/Solder.jpg]] | [[./5_resources/Brass Sponge.jpg]] | [[./5_resources/Flux.jpg]] |
   | What you are melting     | How you clean your iron        | Removes oxides         |
** Other Tools
   - Iron tips 
     - [[./5_resources/Iron Tips.jpg]]
     - Bigger tips, more heat
     - Smaller tips, more precision, easier to break
   - Exhaust Fan
     - Filter fumes while working
   - Desoldering wick
     - Copper mesh to remove solder
   - Desoldering pump
     - Pump to suck solder out of holes
** How to Heat the Parts
   [[./5_resources/Solder heating.png]]
   - Touch the iron to pad and the pin so both heat
   - Apply solder to the pad and pin, not the iron
     - Pull solder away before iron
** How Much Solder to Apply
   [[./5_resources/Through hold ex.jpg]]
   - Enough to fully cover pad, but not so much to look like a bubble
** Through Hole Soldering
   [[./5_resources/Through hole diagram.png]] [[./5_resources/Through hole joint.jpg]]
   - Bend pins slightly outward to hold in place
   - Touch iron to pin and pad to head
   - Apply solder to opposite side of pin (so you are not applying solder to the iron)
   - Clip excess on pins when done soldering
** Surface Mount Soldering
   [[./5_resources/SMD joint.jpg]] [[./5_resources/SMD ex.jpg]]
   - Apply solder to one pad (a corner if many pins)
   - Place component (with tweezers) and solder first pin to pad with solder
   - Solder pin on opposite corner then solder all other pins
** Cleaning Your Iron
   [[./5_resources/Sponges.jpg]]
   - Wet sponge and brass sponge to clean solder from iron
     - Wet sponge cools iron (have to wait for heat back up)
     - Do not hold iron on wet sponge for extended time (could cause damage)
   - Tin the iron when done soldering
     - Clean tip, cover tip in solder, clean again
     - Prevents oxidation and corrosion
* Soldering With Hot Air Gun
[[./5_resources/Hot Air Gun.jpg]]
** Safety
   - Air coming out of hot air gun is very hot
   - Do not set temperature above 400ºC
     - Can cause damage to parts
     - Make sure all parts on your board can handle heat (many connectors cannot and will melt)
   - Turn off before putting back in holder
** Tools
   - Hot air gun
   - Wire rack to place board on (so you don't burn the table)
   - Solder paste
     - Small beads of solder held together with flux
   [[./5_resources/Solder Paste.jpg]]
** Applying Solder Paste
   [[./5_resources/Paste on pads.jpg]] [[./5_resources/Stencil.jpg]]
   - Apply small amount of solder paste to all pads of component
     - Solder will attract to pads so don't have to be exact
   - Use tweezers or syringe to make sure paste is spread evently over pads
   - Place component on top of solder paste
   - For complex boards stencils exist to help place paste
** Heating the Component
   #+ATTR_HTML: :height 25%, :width 25%   
   [[./5_resources/Hot Air Soldering.jpg]]
   - Turn on and flip switch to reworking state
   - Set temperature to ~340ºC and airspeed to ~66
   - Hold tip a distance away to slowly heat up the part
   - Bring tip closer and heat all pads evenly until all is melted
   - Flip switch to cool down and hold tip at component until hot air gun turns off
* Soldering With Reflow Oven
[[./5_resources/Reflow Oven.jpg]]
** Safety
   - Oven gets hot, be careful touching when on
   - Make sure all components you put in oven can stand the heat (many connectors will melt)
** Tools
   - Reflow oven
   - Solder paste
     - Using solder paste the same way as with hot air
** Using the Oven
   #+ATTR_HTML: :height 25%, :width 25%
   [[./5_resources/Reflow Controller.jpg]]
   - Apply solder paste to board same as in hot air
     - Typically apply solder paste to all of board and place all components before putting into oven
     - This is where stencils are more commonly used
   - Place board on center of tray and close the oven
   - Select correct solder profile wave (varies on type of solder paste being used)
   - Start the execution and wait until done (beeps then hit S)
