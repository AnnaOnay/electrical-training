* Basics
** How Solder Works
- Wetting
- Attracts to hottest part

** Good Solder Joints 
** Tools
   | Soldering Iron                   | Hot Air Gun                   | Reflow Oven                   |

   - Flux
     - Remove oxides to allow better solder connections
   - Tweezers
     - Hold small components when soldering
* Soldering With Iron
[[./5_resources/Soldering Iron.jpg]]
** Safety
   - Hold the iron like a pencil
   - Entire metal end gets hot (don't touch)
   - Always assume iron is hot
   - When not in use put back in holder

   | What you are melting     | How you clean your iron        | Removes oxides         |
** Other Tools
   - Iron tips 
     - [[./5_resources/Iron Tips.jpg]]
     - Bigger tips, more heat
     - Smaller tips, more precision, easier to break
   - Exhaust Fan
     - Filter fumes while working
   - Desoldering wick
     - Copper mesh to remove solder
   - Desoldering pump
     - Pump to suck solder out of holes
** How to Heat the Parts
** How Much Solder to Apply
** Through Hole Soldering
   - Bend pins slightly outward to hold in place
** Surface Mount Soldering
   - Solder one pin, then opposite pin
